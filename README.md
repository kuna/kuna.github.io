# How to run locally?

## 1. Install ruby and jekyll

For macOS,

```sh
brew install ruby
# you can install rbenv before gem install for safety.
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin/ jekyll
```


## 2. Now go ahead and run jekyll

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
