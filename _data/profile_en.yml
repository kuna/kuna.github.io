    excerpt: BIBM, Main Author
    time: 2018
    summary: |
      - Model development which find out stress label and biomarkers from time-series mRNA.
      - Used model input as Extracting DEG p-value from Rscript, output as one-hot encoded label
      - Added group effect for data of small cardinality
      - Used CMCL loss for Multiple selection
      - Though small cardinality of learning data set, remarkable output had came out.
